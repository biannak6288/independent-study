# Entry 7: The Final Project Continues

This week I wasn't in class all of the five days because I had to take two AP exams and I had a Model
UN conference. However, I did have a little bit of time to work on my final project. Though I wasn't able 
to put in a lot of effort, I tried to do as much as I could. 

With my fellow classmates, we were able to construct some of the SASS code for our newly developed website, 
and let me tell you it looks amazing! I am proud of us because all the knowledge that we gained and how we were
able to compile it together to form something that is so different is truly beautiful. I am very happy that
I have chosen such great team members to work with and the amount of support that is in the air is really 
motivational when we work. I love it!

Here is a sneak peak at what our work looks like:

```CSS
@mixin font-size-xxx-large {
  font-size: 60px;
}
$color-text: darken(#f2ece4, 15);

@mixin background($imgpath,$position: center ,$repeat: no-repeat) {
    background: {
        image: url($imgpath);
        position: $position;
        repeat: $repeat;
       
    }
}
```

```CSS
$foreground-color:#ffdab9 ;//black;
.contact p{
border-top:4px solid $foreground-color;
  border-bottom:4px solid $foreground-color;
   
  text-transform:uppercase;
  z-index:3;
  //position:relative;
  display:block;
  font-style:italic; 
  text-align: center;
}

.carousel {
  position: relative;
}

.carousel-inner {
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
  width: 100%;
}
```

Well, that is it for this week. I know it wasn't long, but it is something to learn 
from. Hope you enjoyed my short but sweet entry. Now lets get into the takeaways.

## Takeaways

* Don't rush when you're coding to get to the end product because you are only 
going to make MANY BIG mistakes
* Stay positive because not all code works, but that moment when it will begin to
work, there will be lots of relief
* Continue researching more aways to improve your code, because as a software 
engineer, there are plenty ways code continues to evolve and those evolutions might
help ease the complexity of your code
