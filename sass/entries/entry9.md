# Entry 8: The Project is ALMOST Finished

Hello Friends! We are back with another journal entry about my wonderful topic: SASS. I was once again away for a little while during this week, 
therefore I wasn't able to work on the project verry much. However, I took part in certain changes and they are very much effective in terms of
the looks of the site. With the help of SASS, my partners and I were able to create numerous changes that allowed for a better look in the site. 
I am very glad once again that I have such a supportive team of fellow software engineers working with me because if it wasn't for them, then
making this project would be a lot harder.

## Link to My Project
Below is the link to our project now. It is in the working stage, which means that it isn't fully done, but it is in the working stage.

## What We Decided To Do...
Knowing that it is difficult to build things from scratch, we decided to take something that we have built before and change it to make 
it better. To help the production of our SASS website, we decided to use our CSS/Bootstrap project to help with the look. Overall, we used 
the Hot Air Balloon project from junior year as a start, so that we have a basic bootstrap template to work with. 

## Challenges That We Faced
A challenge we faced that was quite predominant was the sizing of every part of the site. The sizing was consistantly off and it made the website
look horrible. However, we are trying to fix that issue now that we have a normal Bootstrap template to work with. This template will make it easier 
for us to work with and will allow room for error.

## Takeaways
* Always research things to help you learn more about what you are trying to do or say. It is important to learn as you build because that is the best way
to learn.
* Don't be afraid to make mistakes because that is absolutely normal in any case. Mistakes teach you how to become better at something and they will 
help you become a stronger individual.
* Don't code for too long. Take times off to take your mind off of what you are doing or else you will give up quite easily. In order to never give up, take
breaks and keep yourself engaged in other things aside from coding that can help exercise your mind.
