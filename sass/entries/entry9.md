## I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S OVER

OMG... I'm graduating in less than a month and all of a sudden everything just became seriously realistic. I don't know if I am ready
to become an adult and begin a new chapter in my life. I am so frightened to see what awaits me on this new path because from now on
I could only depend on myself, and nobody else. Everything is on me now and if I make a mistake, I could only blame myself. 

It's very hard to believe that I have been in school for 12 years and that time has elapsed. I loved every minute of it, the good 
and the bad. There were hard times, but most of my time at school has been the best in my life. I will cherish all the memories
I made forever and I will consistantly reflect upon them. 

Now that you know how I feel about graduation, lets discuss how my final week of the final sep project went. Well, it was **long**. 
I along with my gorup had to work very hard to finish everything on time because we had a lot to do with so many days off due to senior
activities. However, we managed and our project came out exactly how we wanted it to come out. We managed to finish the website on time
and to finish our presentation as well.

I am very proud of my groupmates and I. We made a great team and I am glad that my last project was done with two intelligent woman
who played an important role in my learning of SASS and the other four years of SEP.

## What Our Presentation Consisted Of

1. Several screenshots of how our website looked like before utilizing SASS and after we incorporated SASS
2. Code snippets that showed the difference in the code between CSS and SASS
3. Various explanation of programming language, SASS, that we chose to study for the nine week independent study
4. What our website represents
5. A link for our site to show the final product to our audience

## Takeaways
* Always reflect on your learning in the end
* Respect your groupamtes opinions and ideas if you choose to work with others 
* Be proud of the work you have done despite its inefficiencies
* Remain positive for future learning and building
