# Entry 6: The Final Project Begins

It is officially WEEK SIX!!! I didn't expect it to come so quickly. However, now that I have spent
five weeks prior to this week engaing in the knowledge of SASS, I am finally able to hopefully build
something of my own.

I aong with my two other groupmates had had a hard time this week because I didn't know what to choose 
to do for the final project. We continuously bounced among eachother, but none of them seemed right. 
We started at rebuilding one of our own sites from CSS to SASS, and ended at making a blog page similar
to that of a show that exists called **"Gossip Girl"**. 

As I have said already it was a battle figuring out what to do, and though we haven't exactly set
our minds to one certain thing, we decided to change the CSS in one of our files, the final project file,
into SASS so we can at least have an idea if our learning was worth it.

Below is an example, precisely a snippet of code that my groupmates and I have established:
```CSS
@mixin font-size-xxxx-large {
  font-size: 96px;
}
$color-text: darken(#f2ece4, 15);

h1{
  @include font-size-xxxx-large	;
  color:$color-text;
}
```

It rather corresponds to the work that we have been doing for past several weeks, and is very much related to
ordinary CSS. Therefore, it wasn't that difficult to transform our code from one langauge to an intermediate one.

Due to the fact that we have never coded in this language before, we decided to into various demo examples. I learn
best when I'm shown what to do, which classifies me as a visual learner, therefore these demo examples truly allowed
for my growth in SASS, and in general as a programmer. 

Demos furthered my knowledge on what I needed to know and what I was lacking as a coder in this language. 

Now that my learning has not reached its fullest potential in SASS because that is highly unlikely for a highly 
trained SASS coder, but reached a certain limit where I believe that I could achieve great things, I am ready
to take on any task: big or small.

## Takeaways
* Never say that you know everything on the subject being discussed because ideas conitnuously evolve
* YOU ARE NOT A PRO AT ANYTHING, YOU ARE JUST GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO, BUT YOU ARE NOT A PRO. No one is!
* Stay positive about the situation; if you don't know what to do with your knowledge, keep researching because
an idea will come up sonner or later
* Most importantly --> remain calm and tranquil because that is the only way everything will work out in your favor
